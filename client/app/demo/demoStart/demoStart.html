<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the MakerPass PartnerUp demo!</h2>
<div class="demoStartBody">
PartnerUp is an app built for Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive, aimed at automating the process of creating student groups for coding exercises, whiteboarding, large projects, etc., with a few base goals in mind:
<ul>
<li>Students who have previously worked together (within a user-defined student "pool") should not be paired together again until it is necessary</li>
<li>The history of past groupings should be recorded and should be accessible both for whole classes, and for individual students.</li>
<li>Instructors should have full control over the groupings, able to manually move students around and overwrite the automated groupings any way they desire
</li>
<li>Students should also be able to create groups for people in their classes for personal study sessions, hackathons, or even just recreational tournaments outside of programming</li>
</ul>
<div>PartnerUp is fully integrated with Hack Reactor's MakerPass, allowing for smooth implementation into the existing course administration and structure. Thus, in its current state, PartnerUp is not usable without a MakerPass account, but we do have this demo version to check out if you aren't affiliated with Hack Reactor.</div>
